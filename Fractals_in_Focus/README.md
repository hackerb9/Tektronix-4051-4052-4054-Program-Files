FRACTALS in FOCUS

Jack Miller ported the program he found in 80-Micro magazine May 1985 issue on FRACTALS in FOCUS to run on a Tektronix 4052A computer and take advantage of the 1024x780 vector resolution of the Tektronix 4050 computers.

The program in that magazine article was written for a Tandy Model 3 computer with the high resolution 640x240 graphics option board.

As the 80-MICRO articles indicate, fractals are very interesting, and the program in the May article draws lines - which makes it a great candidate for porting, but you have to understand the BASIC commands for graphics on the Tandy high resolution graphics board and the Tektronix 4050 BASIC.

This program encourages experimentation.  You input the number of "sides" for the fractal and number of "levels".  You also indicate whether you want the inverse fractal (Y) or fractal (N) or both (B) which is Jack's innovation, not found in the magazine program listing.

Requesting more levels means more time to complete the graphic.  The May article mentioned 4 level fractals would take an hour to complete on the Model III with high-resolution graphics.

The 4052/4054 have hardware floating point, so a 5-sided, 4-level, Both fractal only takes 5 minutes to complete the drawing!  The 4051 computer has an 800MHz Motorola 6800 CPU and will likely be similar to the performance of the Model III.

Several screenshots were taken from running Fractals in Focus on the 405x emulator, showing the different patterns for 4-sided just the fractal, and 4-Sided 1/2/3/4 Levels, with Both fractal and inverse fractal.

The photos are of my 4054A showing 5-Sided, 4-Levels,Both, and a closeup of the details of that fractal.

--------------
Two versions of the program - one for all 4050 computers and the 405x emulator, the other version requires a 4052A or 4054A computer.
