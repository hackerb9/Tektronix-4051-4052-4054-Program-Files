Suspended"2804 Dat"from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided"2805 Dat"mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon"2806 Dat"walls.  (the mirror is obviously provided for use by the"2807 Dat"dwarves, who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A small"2808 Dat"window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up."2809 Dat"Z"2810 Dat"1"2811 Dat"You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An"2812 Dat"opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly"2813 Dat"upward.

Marks in the dust around the"3105 Dat"window would seem to indicate that someone has been here"3106 Dat"recently.

Off to one side a great many dwarves are"3119 Dat"sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads"3120 Dat"'do not disturb the dwarves!'

In one corner is a bundle of black rods with"3130 Dat"rusty marks on their ends.  A large number of velvet pillows"3131 Dat"are scattered about on the floor.  A vast mirror stretches"3132 Dat"off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large steel grate,"3133 Dat"next to which is a sign which reads:"3134 Dat"'Treasure vault.
