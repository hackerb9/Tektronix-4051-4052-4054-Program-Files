Jos Dreesen's new AUXMEM Module is his hardware design emulating the TransEra Auxiliary Memory Module for Tektronix 4052/4054 computers.

His AUXMEM module design fits in a single ROM slot and contains 512KB of static RAM with a CR2032 lithium battery backup that should maintain the files for over a year.
